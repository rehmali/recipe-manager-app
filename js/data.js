1. Recipe Cards (Popular Recipes Section)
Practice:

Create an array of recipe objects with properties like title, time, servings, difficulty, imageURL.

Use JS to dynamically generate cards from the array instead of writing them manually.

Add sorting or filtering functionality (e.g., filter by difficulty or cooking time).
