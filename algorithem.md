New Project Idea: "Recipe Manager App"

# Core Concept

A simple app where the user can add, view, search, and delete recipes, each recipe being an object (with name, ingredients, time etc.).

# Features

Add Recipe – User enters name, ingredients (comma-separated), and cooking time.

Display All Recipes – Render recipes dynamically from an array of recipe objects.

Delete Recipe – Remove a recipe from the list (array + DOM).

Search Recipe – Search by name (filter array).

Filter by Cooking Time – (e.g., show recipes under 30 mins).

Bonus: Favorite button (mark/unmark recipes).

# Why This Project?

Arrays of objects like:

js
Copy
Edit
recipes = [
{ name: "Pasta", ingredients: ["Pasta", "Cheese"], time: 20 },
{ name: "Omelette", ingredients: ["Eggs", "Salt"], time: 5 }
];
You’ll practice adding objects, array methods (map, filter, forEach, findIndex).

Heavy DOM updates for displaying, deleting, and filtering recipes.

Alternative Idea (If You Want More Fun): "Expense Tracker App"
Add expenses (description, amount, date) as objects.

Display expenses in a list (array).

Calculate total amount dynamically (using reduce).

Search/filter by date or description.

Delete expense entry.
